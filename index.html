    Solar Panel Data Analysis
    </h3>
    <img src = "\solarpanelestimates.png" alt = "Solar Panel Data" class="center" />
    <h4>
    During the summers of 2021 and 2022, I worked on applying my computer science knowledge to the real world by counting the solar panel capacity within California. Although companies such as Southern California Edison generally have good estimates for industrial solar production, information is limited for private rooftop solar because of its volatility and the potential for 
    predatory pricing by power suppliers. However, if solar is to be used to fight climate change, people need to know when and how to shut off supply of carbon-producing energy sources, which is only possible if Edison is confident that it will not cause blackouts. The graph above has informed approximations from the machine learning model (blue), actual values that the model should predict
    within a variable error tolerance (red), and the values that were given to us for rooftop solar production (green) around Yucaipa, California.

    Especially in California, water is hard to come by. However, there's a lot of water on the coast. What if we just...got rid of the salt? This new process involves passing ionized water through a capacitor and scraping off the excess, which effectively does the trick with little energy, unlike other methods such as reverse osmosis and electrolysis.

    Sudoku Challenge for Oxy Newspaper
    </h3>
    <img src = "\sudoku.png" alt = "Sudoku" width="200" height="100" class = "center" />
    <h4>
    Early on in college, I wanted to test out my newfound coding skills in Python. So, I created a small snippet which checked if a line of Sudoku was valid. That blossomed into a full scale project with the Oxy Open Source community, where we created a program that would generate and confirm sudokus for the college newspaper. I made some great friends and was able to work collaboratively on computer science, both of which
    shaped my choice of major. Source code <a href="https://github.com/michaeljstraus/SodukuForOxy">here</a>

    Streetscope Self-Driving Cars Internship

    <h4>
    Even before Tesla got their automatic cruise control in full swing, I worked with Streetscope to try to beat them to the punch. We used Tensorflow, as well as some proprietary intersection data from Pasadena City Hall, to develop an algorithm which would allow cars to navigate the urban jungle on their own. I did this with the startup Streetscope, which began as a collaboration between Erik Antonsson, founder of many companies including
    aiPod, and Mark Goodstein, his technical assistant. I met with them regularly and was able to move pieces of their code to AWS and Azure to improve efficiency for their hazard collision measuring technology. Website <a href="https://www.streetscope.com/">here</a>

    <h4>
    The Borgen Project is a multinational charity which aims to raise awareness about international poverty, and encourage the US to put more funds into agencies such as IMF and the World Bank. During my internship in the summer of 2020, I lobbied members of Congress, wrote articles,
    fundraised $500, and created op eds in my local newspaper. I also learned a lot about how simple goods that we take for granted, such as clean water and proper housing, actually take a lot of investment and time to utilize properly. Articles are:

    <h4>
    iDTech is a summer camp with an emphasis on preparing high school students for computer science degrees. With my coding experience, I was able to teach courses in blockchain and machine learning. Every student had a project at the end of the week which I helped them produce, whether
    that was a new cryptocurrency through Python, a soccer logo detection algorithm, or a webcam that allowed you to play rock paper scissors against it. I also designed my own lesson plans using datasets from around the Web, such as Uber trip info or the Etherium mainframe.
    One project that came out really well is <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J2rgOIh7LPOgy-Z_yMSU435ULqbzNwct?usp=sharing">here</a>

    <h4>
    STEAM:CODERS is a volunteer-run organization which aims to provide technical education to all strata of society. They do so with both Los Angeles-based and virtual classes. I taught a machine learning class with them in April-May of 2021, and I was able to lead powerpoints as 
    as assist with one-on-one troubleshooting for students who were having issues. We designed through Scratch a way to identify various animals from one another.

    Last year, I wanted to try something new at college, so i participated in Occidental's Dance Pro club. It was super fun, and I learned more about tap dancing than I ever would have expected! The performance in the spring was wonderful as well.

    I've been golfing on and off for 7 years. Most recently, I was on the Bishop O'Dowd varsity golf team, and played in several tournaments. I like playing on Metropolitan in Oakland, even though the wind sometimes sends my shot where it shouldn't be. I'm always looking to work on my short game.
