    Solar Panel Data Analysis

    During the summers of 2021 and 2022, I worked on applying my computer science knowledge to the real world by counting the solar panel capacity within California. Although companies such as Southern California Edison generally have good estimates for industrial solar production, information is limited for private rooftop solar because of its volitility and the potential for 
    predatory pricing by power suppliers. However, if solar is to be used to fight climate change, people need to know when and how to shut off supply of carbon-producing energy sources, which is only possible if Edison is confident that it will not cause blackouts. The graph above has informed approximations from the machine learning model (blue), actual values that the model should predict
    within a variable error tolerance (red), and the values that were given to us for rooftop solar production (green) around Yucaipa, California.

    Especially in California, water is hard to come by. However, there's a lot of water on the coast. What if we just...got rid of the salt? This new process involves passing ionized water through a capacitor and scraping off the excess, which effectively does the trick with little energy, unlike other methods such as reverse osmosis and electrolysis.

    Sudoku Challenge for Oxy Newspaper

    <font size = "12">
    Early on in college, I wanted to test out my newfound coding skills in Python. So, I created a small snippet which checked if a line of Sudoku was valid. That blossomed into a full scale project with the Oxy Open Source community, where we created a program that would generate and confirm sudokus for the college newspaper. I made some great friends and was able to work collaboratively on computer science, both of which
    shaped my choice of major. Source code <a href="https://github.com/michaeljstraus/SodukuForOxy">here</a>

    Even before Tesla got their automatic cruise control in full swing, I worked with Streetscope to try to beat them to the punch. We used Tensorflow, as well as some proprietary intersection data from Pasadena City Hall, to develop an algorithm which would allow cars to navigate the urban jungle on their own. I did this with the startup Streetscope, which began as a collaboration between Erik Antonsson, founder of many companies including
    aiPod, and Mark Goodstein, his technical assistant. I met with them regularly and was able to move pieces of their code to AWS and Azure to improve efficiency for their hazard collision measuring technology. Website <a href="https://www.streetscope.com/">here</a>
