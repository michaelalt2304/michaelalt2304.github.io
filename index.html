    Solar Panel Data Analysis

    <h3>
    During the summers of 2021 and 2022, I worked on applying my computer science knowledge to the real world by counting the solar panel capacity within California. Although companies such as Southern California Edison generally have good estimates for industrial solar production, information is limited for private rooftop solar because of its volitility and the potential for 
    predatory pricing by power suppliers. However, if solar is to be used to fight climate change, people need to know when and how to shut off supply of carbon-producing energy sources, which is only possible if Edison is confident that it will not cause blackouts. The graph above has informed approximations from the machine learning model (blue), actual values that the model should predict
    within a variable error tolerance (red), and the values that were given to us for rooftop solar production (green) around Yucaipa, California.

    Especially in California, water is hard to come by. However, there's a lot of water on the coast. What if we just...got rid of the salt? This new process involves passing ionized water through a capacitor and scraping off the excess, which effectively does the trick with little energy, unlike other methods such as reverse osmosis and electrolysis.
